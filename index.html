<h1>Get Involved!</h1>
<section>
	<h2>London, we want to hear from you.</h2>
    <p><img src="images/cityview.png" width="200" height="150" alt="city view"/>Check out our online engagement tool Get Involved London to learn about current, ongoing and past community consultations. Get Involved London is a place for Londoners to learn about and participate in City projects and initiatives. If you want to make your views known about a matter being considered by a committee of Council you can request to speak or submit comments. In order to be given delegation status (request to speak) at a Standing Committee meeting you must make a request in writing to the City Clerk’s Office stating the purpose of your request.  If it falls within the jurisdiction of the City of London we will place the request on the next available agenda for the appropriate Standing Committee. The Standing Committee will then make a recommendation to Municipal Council as to whether or not they wish to receive the delegation at a future meeting of the Standing Committee. </p>
	<h2>Other ways to help shape our city:</h2>
    <p>The City of London has made public engagement a priority in its strategic plan because we see you as a partner with access to information that will help Council make decisions about our future.We’ll show you how to look up events of interest, how you register to speak at committees, and where to find key pieces of information. This page will help you learn how your municipal government works so you can tap into the opportunities to have your say. Londoners want to be informed, connected and engaged. Now you can easily find information and have your say on range of City initiatives.</p>
